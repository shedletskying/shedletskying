 O1 - *c + h are allowed in ponytown, unless with friends. you will NEVER catch me using touch triggers lol*
  ***
O2 - i use w2i only when offtab, but if im afk, no respone in guaranteed, but when whispering, late response. 

O3 - please no copying or inspo on my ponies.

O4 - i either play on computer or mobile, on mobile i may be a bit slower than usual.
***
O5 - please avoid covering unless your a friend, i wont get mad but its annoying.

O6 - i rarely ever have dni, dnuid, dniuf in my name, so you cant pretty much interact whenever, except for when im afk.

O7 - i may get really awkward sometimes and respond with 'oh' or just kinda move around when i dont know what to say, so sorry if that happens.

O8 - you can find me at the fnaf, dandys world, or the osc area.
