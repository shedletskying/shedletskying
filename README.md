> c*h is always welcomed but ask first, especially since i mostly sit around my friends. i enjoy making friends so interact if you please. i don't mind covering, though it can be annoying if you do it alot. i've never had any issues with people copying my ponys, but that doesn't mean its okay.

> i don't accept random friend requests unless we've interact a lot, and i took a liking to you.

> i'm mostly afk, so whisper to interact even when its not in my name, because i may not answer unless im checking the tab (rarely)
